# Maze-Solver
Welcome to my maze solver project. I'm aiming to get a solid grasp on many graph concepts using this project, such as Prim's, Kruskals, BFS and DFS. 
Although I have studied them, I've never gotten the chance to apply them in a project. 

## To Do 
- [ ] Working Linked Lists
- [ ] Implement Graphs via Adjacency List
- [ ] Implement graph generation using MST algo 
- [ ] Visualize graph so it looks like maze 
- [ ] Implement alg to solve maze
